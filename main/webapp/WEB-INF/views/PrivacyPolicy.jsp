		items visitors are likely to click on most, the way visitors are

		pages on the Website, how long visitors to the Website are staying and
		how often they are visiting. It also helps us diagnose problems with
		our servers and lets us better administer our systems. Although such

		to determine from an IP address a visitor's Internet Service Provider
		(ISP), and the approximate geographic location of his or her point of
		connectivity.<br />

		"cookies" on your personal computer. "Cookies" are small identifiers
		sent from a web server and stored on your computer's hard drive, that

		site uses cookies to track how you found our site. To protect your
		privacy we do not use cookies to store or transmit any personal
		information about you on the Internet. You have the ability to accept

		but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies if
		you prefer. If you choose to decline cookies certain features of the
		site may not function property or at all as a result.<br />

		enhance services available on the Website. To the extent these
		services are provided, and used by you, we will use the information
