		   <h3>Right to Cancellation By SRS In Case Of Invalid Information From User</h3>
	   <div>
          <div class="content">
		  <p>The User expressly undertakes to provide to SRS only correct and valid information while requesting for any services under this agreement, and not to make any misrepresentation of facts at all. Any default on part of the User would vitiate this agreement and shall disentitle the User from availing the services from SRS.<br /><br />

In case SRS discovers or has reasons to believe at any time during or after receiving a request for services from the User that the request for services is either unauthorized or the information provided by the User or any of them is not correct or that any fact has been misrepresented by him/her, SRS in its sole discretion shall have the unrestricted right to take any steps against the User(s), including cancellation of the fees paid, etc. without any prior intimation to the User. In such an event, SRS shall not be responsible or liable for any loss or damage that may be caused to the User or any of them as a consequence of such cancellation of the fees paid or services.<br /><br />

The User unequivocally indemnifies SRS of any such claim or liability and shall not hold SRS responsible for any loss or damage arising out of measures taken by SRS for safeguarding its own interest and that of its genuine Clients. This would also include SRS denying/cancelling any fees, registration, etc on account of suspected fraud transactions.
Fees once paid are nonrefundable for any reason or any cancellation as per the clause of NIT Jalandhar.
